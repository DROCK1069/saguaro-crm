/**
 * Win/loss surfacing feed. Reads the tenant's learned trade_win_factors (produced by
 * the learner behind POST /api/bids/outcome) plus a headline won/lost tally from
 * bid_history, so dashboards / bid-intelligence / the estimator can show "where we
 * win and where we're leaving money on the table" without re-running the learner.
 *
 * Service-role client bypasses RLS → every read is explicitly tenant-scoped.
 * winRate is a 0..1 fraction over DECIDED (won+lost) bids, or null when none are decided.
