# THE MODULE PATTERN — the law every module screen follows

*Owner directive, 2026-08-24: "MATCH MIRROR THE STYLE U DID FOR MOBILE RFI WITH DESIGN.
I WANT THAT SAME PATTERN DESIGN STRUCTURE ON ALL MODULES FOR THE PLATFORM
ESPECIALLY MOBILE BUT THE WEB AND MOBILE MUST MATCH."*

**The reference implementation is `app/rfis.tsx` in the mobile repo.** When this
document and that file disagree, that file wins — read it before building.

**Why this exists:** of 95 mobile module screens, exactly **2** (`rfis.tsx`,
`punch.tsx`) carried the full kit. The other 93 are why a GC opens the app and
says it looks like a stubbed knock-off. This spec closes that gap.

## THE SIX LAYERS

Every module screen has all six. A module missing one is not done.

### 1. Header with identity
Module accent color · title · **live count** of the number that matters
(open RFIs, overdue items, unbilled dollars) · primary create action in the header.
- Mobile: `<ScreenHeader title count onAdd accent={moduleAccent('x').hex} />`
- Web: `<ModuleHero accentColor eyebrow title />` with the primary action in the hero.

### 2. Control row
**Filter chips carrying live counts per status**, then **sort chips** beneath.
- Render filters only when there is more than one row; sort only when > 1 row.
- Mobile: `<FilterChips options={[{value,label,count}]} />` then `<SortChips>` +
  `useSortState(screenKey)` so the choice persists per screen.
- Web: `ListToolbar` filters + the sortable `DataTable` (`tableId` persists the sort).
- Filter/sort state persists per user per screen. Never resets on navigation.

### 3. Insight band — ONE genuinely computed metric
RFIs show **open-RFI aging** (days outstanding, warmer = older). Every module gets
the equivalent: a real number computed from that module's real rows.

**HONESTY RULE — the hard one.** The insight must be derived from actual data.
If a module has no meaningful metric, render the **status/count breakdown** instead.
**Never** invent a chart, a trend line, a benchmark, or a percentage the data cannot
support. A truthful count beats a decorative graph. If fewer than 3 rows exist,
skip the band entirely rather than charting noise.

Suggested honest metrics by module family (derive, do not fabricate):
- **Aging / turnaround** (RFIs, submittals, punch, change orders, approvals):
  days outstanding per open item.
- **Money** (invoices, pay apps, budget, commitments, direct costs, contracts):
  billed vs. remaining, retainage held, overdue dollars — all `Number()`-coerced
  because money columns are TEXT in this schema.
- **Schedule** (schedule, milestones, deliveries, look-ahead): items due this week
  vs. overdue.
- **Compliance** (insurance, lien waivers, W-9, certified payroll, safety):
  current vs. expiring vs. expired counts.
- **Volume/activity** (daily logs, photos, meetings, time): entries per day over
  the last 14 days.

### 4. The row card anatomy
In this order, every module:
1. **Identifier** (`#12`) + **status pills** (status, plus Urgent / Overdue when true)
   + **row menu** (edit / archive / restore).
2. **Title**, clamped to 2 lines.
3. **Body preview**, truncated.
4. **Derived highlight box** when the module has a "resolution" concept — the RFI
   Answer box, with **author and timestamp**. (Punch: the fix. CO: the approval.)
5. **Attribution line** — ball-in-court / assignee / vendor.
6. **Footer** — the date that matters + badges (attachments, photos).
7. **"Syncing" pill** whenever the row is a pending offline write.

Web renders the same information as table columns + an expandable row or detail
panel; the *information and its order* must match, not the pixels.

### 5. Three crafted empty states — never one generic void
- **First-run**: accented medallion icon · headline · a subtitle that TEACHES what
  the module is for · primary action button · **tappable starter chips that
  pre-fill the create form** (RFIs: common questions). Starters must be real and
  module-appropriate.
- **Filtered-empty**: different icon, "Try a different filter."
- **Archived-empty**: its own copy.
- **Loading** is a skeleton, never a blank screen.
- **Error** is inline with a Retry, never a silent blank.
- **No-project** is a *picker*, never a wall telling the user to go elsewhere.

### 6. The create sheet teaches while you type
In this order:
1. **FormHeader** — accent, icon, module eyebrow, one-line subtitle saying what
   this record does.
2. **SmartCreate StatStrip — what the system ALREADY KNOWS.** The next number and
   what it follows, the current open/overdue load, the default assignee. Real
   values from real rows.
3. **AUTO chip + FieldHint** on every pre-filled value, in plain English, saying
   *why*: "Response due in 7 days — the standard turnaround. Tap the date to
   change it." The chip flips to EDITED the moment the user overrides it.
4. **FieldGroups** — labeled, icon'd sections (Request / Routing), never a flat
   wall of inputs.
5. **FormKit primitives** — `KitInput` / `KitSelect` / `PrioritySegments` /
   `DateField` with required markers, real placeholders, helper text.
6. **Voice dictation** on every long-form text field.
7. **Unsaved-work guard** (`useUnsavedGuard`) + draft autosave on every create flow.

## MODULE IDENTITY
One accent per module from `lib/module-identity.ts` (mirrored byte-identical on
both repos), threaded through header, medallion, chips, field groups, and pills.
Accents live on chips/badges/eyebrows — never on body text or large fills.

## WEB ↔ MOBILE PARITY
"Match" means **same anatomy, same information, same order, same accent, same
counts, same auto-fill explanations, same starter actions** — expressed through
each platform's kit (`components/ui/premium.tsx` on web, `components/FormKit` +
`SmartCreate` + `FilterChips` + `SortChips` on mobile). A GC moving from laptop to
phone must recognize one product. Pixel-identical is not the goal; recognizable
sameness is.

## WHAT "DONE" MEANS FOR A MODULE
All six layers present · every save reports honestly (never a fake success) ·
every record lands on the ACTIVE project · offline writes show a Syncing pill ·
`tsc` clean · `npm run audit` 0 new · and the insight band is computed from real
rows or absent. Anything less is not done, and must be reported as not done.
